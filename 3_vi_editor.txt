Command mode -  when vi starts up, it is in command mode. This mode is where vi interprets any characters we type as commands.
                This does not display them in windows. To enter into command mode, from any other mode, it requires pressing Esc key.

Insert Mode - This mode enables you to insert text into file. To come in insert mode you simply type 'i'.
            To get out of insert mode, press the ESC key.

Lost Line Mode - Lost Line mode is invoked by typing a color [:], while vi is in command mode. 
                 The cursor will jump to the last line of the screen and vi will wait for command
